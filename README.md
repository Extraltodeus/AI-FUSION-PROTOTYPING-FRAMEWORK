# AI-FUSION-PROTOTYPING-FRAMEWORK

(The current weather is cooking me to hard to write a readme)

(This is an AI merging framework made to quickly throw ideas with some of my latest functionalities)

(Despite no readme it is functional and you can find it in "Experimental model merging" in the menu)

(as usual it's for comfyui)
